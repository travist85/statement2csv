# SEO Operations Plan

Last updated: 2026-02-19

## Purpose

Run SEO as an operations system for BankSheet:
- predictable cadence
- low decision fatigue
- compounding output

Core idea:
- SEO is not a one-off marketing task
- SEO is a repeatable production workflow

## Operating Model

- Input: product reality + user pain points
- Process: keyword cluster -> draft -> edit -> publish -> internal links -> indexing
- Output: 2 publishable pages per week
- Review: weekly Search Console + conversion funnel review

Primary outcome:
- reliable throughput, not perfect posts

## Product-Intent Keyword Clusters

## 1) Conversion intent
- bank statement pdf to csv
- convert bank statement to xlsx
- bank statement converter

## 2) Workflow pain
- extract transactions from pdf statement
- split debit credit csv
- invert debit credit export

## 3) Comparison intent
- pdf statement vs bank csv export
- when bank export is missing

## 4) Role/use-case intent
- bank statement converter for bookkeepers
- small business reconciliation statement export

## Weekly Workflow

1. Select one keyword cluster from backlog.
2. Publish one high-intent landing page.
3. Publish one practical guide/tutorial page.
4. Add 3-5 internal links from/into both pages.
5. Submit each new URL in Search Console URL Inspection.
6. Review the weekly KPI dashboard.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- Publish every week, even if draft quality is 80%.
- Do not re-open keyword research unless backlog is empty.
- Do not rewrite a page before 14 days of data.
- Prefer relevance and consistency over volume.

## 6-Week Content Plan (2 pages/week)

Week 1:
- /bank-statement-pdf-to-csv
- /guides/convert-bank-statement-pdf-to-csv-step-by-step

Week 2:

Week 6:

## Page Template (Standardized)

For every page:
- One intent-matched H1
- Short problem statement
- How BankSheet solves it
- Step-by-step workflow
- Known limitations and edge cases
- FAQ (3-5 questions)
- CTA to use the tool
- Internal links to 2-3 related pages
