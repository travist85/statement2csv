# Issue Labels (MVP Traction)

Use a small, consistent label set while testing MVP fit.

## Core labels

- `bug`: general product malfunction
- `parser`: parsing accuracy/normalization issues
- `feedback`: UX or product feedback
- `question`: support/usage questions
- `high-priority`: immediate fix for conversion trust
- `good-first-issue`: suitable for a small contributor task

## Triage rule of thumb

- If conversion output is wrong: `bug` + `parser`
- If user asks for clearer wording/UI: `feedback`
- If user asks how to use feature: `question`
- Add `high-priority` when issue blocks reliable conversion
