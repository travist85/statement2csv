# Roadmap

## MVP traction mode (current)

Goal: get real usage and feedback before building more features.

What we are optimizing for:
- upload PDF -> convert -> download usable CSV
- clear trust messaging (privacy + delete-after-conversion)
- fast iteration from real user feedback

## In scope now

- improve parsing reliability for text-based PDFs
- keep export options clear and simple
- collect issues/questions from early users
- keep deployment and rollback process stable

## Out of scope until traction

- OCR fallback
- OFX/QIF and other formats
- batch conversion
- advanced integrations

## Exit criteria for MVP traction phase

- consistent successful conversions on known sample PDFs
- at least a small stream of real user feedback/issues
- clear signal on the top 3 requested improvements
